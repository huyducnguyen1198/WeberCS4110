# CS4110: Computer Theory and Applications

## Overview
This repository contains practical projects and exercises for CS4110, aligning with "Introduction to Computer Theory" by Daniel I. A. Cohen. It includes hands-on applications of computational theory concepts such as Turing machines and automata theory.

## Key Topics
- **CS4110Turing**: Implementations and examples related to Turing machines.
- **Kleene's Theorem (Regex to FA)**: Practical conversion of regular expressions to finite automata.
- **Textbook Reference**: Daniel I. A. Cohen's "Introduction to Computer Theory" provides the theoretical foundation for the course.

## Course Objectives
- Understand and apply core concepts of computer theory.
- Translate theoretical knowledge into practical computational models.
